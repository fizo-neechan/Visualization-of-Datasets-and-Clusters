# Visualization-of-Datasets-and-Clusters

The main aim of the project is to visualize data presented by the instructor in a more optimized manner where groups of similar classes of objects are easily detectable.

In Task 2, We see how we can rearrange the permutated/dispersed dataset by applying the Signature Technique.

In Task 3, We can visualize the data as clusters that are grouped by different properties of the data. This is a method of unsupervised learning in Machine Learning Models.

In both these tasks, after the dataset has been rearranged into a more readable format, the data is shown to an expert (in the respective field), and they are able to showcase what the visualization signifies.
